# AI 

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4WZ_k0vUDM) appeared on my newsfeed a few years back - regarding AI capabilities. What seemed harmless at first is actually detrimental to our childrens' future. There is no better way to explain it, than to watch the video.

# PHISHING ATTACKS

**TRUE STORY!!**

I'm a sucker for dogs and this is what a phishing attack looks like. Whatever your kryptonite is, hackers will know. I got an email about a lost puppy and based on the context of the email, all I had to do was click on the link (photo). Without thinking, I clicked on the [link](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e22cfcbd-5d30-48d0-9cb9-8ac5cd3e3e27)

A few tips to consider before clicking on a link
1. It's OK to ask the sender "what is it?".
2.  NEVER assume that the link is SAFE because you know the sender.
3.  Look for spelling errors.
4.  If you are not expecting an email from someone or from a company, do **not** click it.
   
**I should NOT have clicked on that link but how could I not, right?**

# Cryptography

This is [Plaintext](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a427079f-b91c-49e9-ae4e-ce67d7f23463)
I want to sorta [hide it](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fea42c4a-50b0-474b-8f54-f66911bfa761)
Then completely [hide the text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3fea4e9-63e4-469c-8281-c3f60108121f)

# Programming

I want to write an interactive code using this platform but this is yet to be determined.
