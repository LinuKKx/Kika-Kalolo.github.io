# AI

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4WZ_k0vUDM) appeared on my newsfeed a few years back - advanced technology with AI capabilities. What seemed harmless at first turned out to be detrimental to our tamaiti (childrens') future. There is no better way to explain it, than to watch the video.

# PHISHING ATTACKS

**TRUE STORY!!**

I'm a sucker for dogs and this is what a phishing attack looks like. Whatever your kryptonite is, hackers will know. I got an email about a lost puppy and based on the context of the email, all I had to do was click on the link because a photo of the puppy photo was attached. Without thinking, I clicked on the link.

A few tips to consider before clicking on a link:
1. It's OK to ask the sender "what is it?".
2. NEVER assume that the [link](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e22cfcbd-5d30-48d0-9cb9-8ac5cd3e3e27) is SAFE because you know the sender.
3. Look for spelling errors.
4. If you didn't enter a competition, do not accept the Invite.
**I should NOT have clicked on that link but how could I not, right?**

# Cryptography

This is Plaintext![plaintext](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a427079f-b91c-49e9-ae4e-ce67d7f23463)
I want to sorta hide it![hide](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fea42c4a-50b0-474b-8f54-f66911bfa761)
Then completely hide the ![text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3fea4e9-63e4-469c-8281-c3f60108121f)





# Programming

I want to write an interactive code using this platform but this is yet to be trialled.
