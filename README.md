# PHISHING ATTACKS

**TRUE STORY!!**

I'm a sucker for dogs and this is what a phishing attack looks like. Whatever your kryptonite is, hackers will know.
1. Be mindful of clicking onto links.
2. It's OKAY to ask the sender "what is it?".
3. NEVER assume that the [link]![hacked](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e22cfcbd-5d30-48d0-9cb9-8ac5cd3e3e27) is SAFE because you know the sender.
4. ALWAYS stay vigilant.
